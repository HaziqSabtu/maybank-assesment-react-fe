## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Google Maps API key

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080 (or your backend url)
```

Don't have a Google Maps API key? Try the deployed version at [Vercel](https://maybank-assesment-react-fe.vercel.app/)

Make sure the following Google Cloud APIs are enabled if you use your own key:

-   Maps JavaScript API
-   Places API

### 3. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### 4. (Optional) Run the backend server

This part is optional, but recommended to be able to save favorites. [see README](https://github.com/HaziqSabtu/maybank-assesment-spring-be).
